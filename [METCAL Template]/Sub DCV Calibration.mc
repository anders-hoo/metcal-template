# Tests with NMEAS = 1 require that U1 and U2 uncertainty components are calculated
# manually. These required at minimum: the standard's normalized accuracy (TSET U1),
# manually calculated TSET U2 = RSS2(S1,S2) = (RSS2(SDEV(N,N)/NMEAS,0.5*UUT_RES/sqrt(3)))
# and SYSTEM ACTUAL for evaluation statement MEM = AVG(1,10)

# Accuracies should be declared at the beginning of the test using descriptive variables and
# normalized to 1-sigma. The test below with NMEAS = 1 and manual calculation of U1 & U2 values
# from 10 measurements is identical to test 5.00X above. If possible avoid the NMEAS = 1 method
# NMEAS = 1 might be necessary in situations where measurement configuration is changed mid test
# to reverse leads to offset lead resistance etc.
