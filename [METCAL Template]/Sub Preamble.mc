# VSET MEAS = SA is useful when using MEMC and MEMCX FSCs when DUT is stimulus instrument
# And the measurement standard is an indicator. VSET MEAS = SA instructs
# the system to treat SYSTEM ACTUAL as the measurement result which is transferred
# to the report database. VSET MEAS defaults to UI (DUT INDICATED). Using VSET MEAS = SA
# when the measurement standard is an indicator allows efficient use of MEMC and MEMCX
# FSCs. Writing down the explicit nominal value is not necessary. Only explicitly writing
# the TOL value in necessary. For example. Variable TOL value can be set programmatically
# with IF ELSEIF ENDIF statements.
